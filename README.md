# MongoDB C++ Driver [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver.svg?branch=legacy)](https://travis-ci.org/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver)[![Windows Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/w95xuowdjpr0img1/branch/legacy?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/markbenvenuto/mongo-cxx-driver)

Welcome to the MongoDB C++ Driver!

This branch contains the legacy C++ driver.  We encourage everyone to use
the actively maintained `mongocxx` driver in the master branch instead.

**NOTE: The legacy driver has reached end-of-life status. Its use is strongly discouraged.**
